== About me
Hi :), I am Yuanxin Guo, a 3rd year undergrad from [https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/ the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)]. I am a math major student and my main research interest lies in information theory and coding theory.

I am planning to join [https://www.utoronto.ca/ University of Toronto] this summer as a research intern. I will be supervised by Prof. [http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~sdraper/ Stark Draper]. 

I am currently doing an internship at the Wireless Technology Laboratory, [https://www.huawei.com/en/ Huawei Technologies] since January 2021. Meanwhile I am affiliated with the [https://shhyang.github.io/nclab/ Network Coding Lab] at CUHK-Shenzhen and the [http://www.sribd.cn/ Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data] as research assistants.

I have gained some teaching experience as an undergraduate student teaching fellow. The courses I have taught include Calculus I, Linear Algebra, and Complex Variables. 

I am seeking for a PhD position in information theory\/statistics\/operations research starting in the 2022 fall. A brief CV is available [short_cv.pdf here].

== News
- 21\/5\/3 I will be the presenting author of the paper `Successively Solvable Shift-Add Systems - A Graphical Characterization.' @ IEEE ISIT 2021.
- 21\/4\/30 Two papers @ [https://shhyang.github.io/nclab/ nclab] have been accepted by IEEE ISIT 2021! Camera-ready version (and hopefully, the presentation slides) would be soon available.
