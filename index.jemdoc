== About me
Hi :), I am Yuanxin Guo, a 4th year undergrad from [https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/ the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)]. I am a math major student and my main research interest lies in information theory, coding theory and data science.

I am currently a research intern at the [https://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/ Multimedia Lab], [https://www.utoronto.ca/ University of Toronto] as a research intern. I am supervised by Prof. [http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~sdraper/ Stark Draper]. Meanwhile, I am affiliated with the [https://shhyang.github.io/nclab/ Network Coding Lab] at CUHK-Shenzhen (supervisor: Prof. [https://shhyang.github.io/ Shenghao Yang]) and the [http://www.sribd.cn/ Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data] (supervisor: Prof. [https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/luozhiquan/ Zhi-Quan Luo]) as research assistants. Prior to that, I have done an internship at the Wireless Technology Laboratory, [https://www.huawei.com/en/ Huawei Technologies] from January 2021 to May 2021. 

I have gained some teaching experience as an undergraduate student teaching fellow. The courses I have taught include Calculus I, Linear Algebra, and Complex Variables. I am now teaching Abstract Algebra I, my typeset notes could be found [teaching.html here].

I am seeking for a PhD position in information theory\/coding theory\/mathematics starting in the 2022 fall. A brief CV is available [short_cv.pdf here].
