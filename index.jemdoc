== About me
Hi :), I am Yuanxin Guo, a third year Ph.D. student at [https://www.utoronto.ca/ University of Toronto] co-advised by Prof. [http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~sdraper/ Stark Draper] and Prof. [https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~weiyu/ Wei Yu]. My research interest lies in various fields, including information theory, coding theory and data science.



Prior to joining U of T, I graduated from [https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/ the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)]. I gained research experience at the [https://shhyang.github.io/nclab/ Network Coding Lab] in CUHK-Shenzhen (advisor: Prof. [https://shhyang.github.io/ Shenghao Yang]) and the [http://www.sribd.cn/ Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data] (advisor: Prof. [https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/luozhiquan/ Zhi-Quan Luo]). I have worked as a research intern at the Wireless Technology Laboratory in [https://www.huawei.com/en/ Huawei Technologies] from January 2021 to May 2021. 



I have gained some teaching experience as an undergraduate student teaching fellow at CUHK-Shenzhen and as a teaching assistant at UofT. At CUHK-Shenzhen I have taught Calculus I, Linear Algebra, Complex Variables and Abstract Algebra I. At UofT I have taught Convex Optimization and Multiuser Information Theory. Some of my teaching notes could be found [teaching.html here].

- 24\/7\/6 I will be presenting a poster `One-Shot Achievability Region for Hypothesis Testing with Communication Constraint' at [http://infotheory.ca/nasit2024/index.html NASIT 2024].
- 21\/7\/6 One paper `On the Equivalence between Pre-transformed and Parity-check Monomial Codes' has been accepted as poster by ISTC 2021. The work is conducted during my internship at Huawei Technologies with Zihan Tang and Bin Li.
- 21\/5\/3 I will be the presenting author of the paper `Successively Solvable Shift-Add Systems - A Graphical Characterization.' @ IEEE ISIT 2021.
- 21\/4\/30 Two papers @ [https://shhyang.github.io/nclab/ nclab] have been accepted by IEEE ISIT 2021! Camera-ready version (and hopefully, the presentation slides) would be soon available.
