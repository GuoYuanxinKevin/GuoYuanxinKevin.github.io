== About me
Hi :), I am Yuanxin Guo, an incoming Ph.D. student at the [https://www.utoronto.ca/ University of Toronto]. I am going to graduate from [https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/ the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)]. My research interest lies in various fields, including information theory, coding theory and data science.

This September, I am joining [https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/ the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering] at UofT, where I am going to be co-advised by Prof. [http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~sdraper/ Stark Draper] and Prof. [https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~weiyu/ Wei Yu]. Meanwhile, I am affiliated with the [https://shhyang.github.io/nclab/ Network Coding Lab] at CUHK-Shenzhen (supervisor: Prof. [https://shhyang.github.io/ Shenghao Yang]) and the [http://www.sribd.cn/ Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data] (supervisor: Prof. [https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/luozhiquan/ Zhi-Quan Luo]) as research assistants. Prior to that, I have done an internship at the Wireless Technology Laboratory, [https://www.huawei.com/en/ Huawei Technologies] from January 2021 to May 2021. 

I have gained some teaching experience as an undergraduate student teaching fellow. The courses I have taught include Calculus I, Linear Algebra, and Complex Variables and Abstract Algebra I. My typeset notes could be found [teaching.html here].
